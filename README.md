# Project Seed
> Start GROWING your coding skills with Project Seed!

Project Seed is an open-source, friendly, online community for new developers who want to work on awesome projects, start a team or have an exciting idea for a new application!

https://wwww.projectseed.dev

## How It Works
The goal of this platform is to allow new developers to gain experience working with others and to share any project ideas they want to create. This is beneficial for the more experienced developers who want to give back to the coder community and have another platform to continue to build a stronger online present.

Each week selected projects will be featured on the front and main page.
